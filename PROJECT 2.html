<p>Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI),[5] previously known as PUBG Mobile India,[6] is a version of PUBG Mobile, available in India.[7][8][9][10] It is an online multiplayer battle royale game by Krafton.[11] The game was initially released on 2 July 2021 for Android devices,[11] and on 18 August 2021 for iOS devices. There are two official tournaments in a calendar year in BGMI, held by Krafton India Esports. The first is BGMI India Series (BGIS) and the later one is BGMI Pro Series
    As of July 2022, BGMI surpassed 170 million downloads on the Google Play Store.[12] The game was banned in India on July 28, 2022, by the Indian government.[13] According to a statement from Krafton, the ban was removed on May 26, 2023.[14]</p>

    <p>Battlegrounds Mobile India is a battle royale game, in which up to 100 players compete in a large-scale last man standing deathmatch. Players can enter the match as individuals or as small groups of up to four.
 Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the several maps. Each round, the plane's flight path across the map changes, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground. Players begin with no equipment other than customised clothing options that have no effect on gameplay. Once on the ground, players can search buildings, ghost towns, and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armour, and other items. At the start of a match, these items are procedurally distributed throughout the map, with higher-risk zones typically having better equipment. Finished players can also be looted for their gear. Players can choose to play in first-person or third-person, with each having advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness.</p><hr>
